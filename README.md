# streamlit-dashboard
 In this repo, I will show how I created a dashboard webapplication only using python and the streamlit library, without know nothing about django or flask frameworks.
 
 # Creating the database
 First you need to run the cria_random_dataset.py file. It will output a test database, and in my case it is the base_dataset2.csv.
 After this you need to execute the code above in your terminal 
 
 ```
 streamlit run VIT_BANK.py
 
 ```
 
Wait a little bit. If everything is allrigth, your terminal will give you a message saying something like this
